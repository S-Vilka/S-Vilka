# Sergei Vilka
## Project Management and Software Development 

I'm Sergei, a second-year ICT student @MetropoliaUAS. 

I'm passionate about combining technical expertise with strong organisational skills to deliver impactful projects. With hands-on experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies, Iâ€™ve served as a Scrum Master for multiple university projects, fostering collaboration and ensuring smooth progress.

ðŸ”­ Currently seeking summer trainee opportunities to grow as a project manager or developer while contributing to meaningful projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something great together!

ðŸ’» My technical toolkit includes React.js, Node.js, Java, MongoDB, and Git, with a focus on building efficient and user-friendly applications.

ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm studying Java and Project Management. For the latest project, you can check this link:
